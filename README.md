# COVID-19 Detection

I randomly sampled 1000 images of normal chest X-ray images from this [torrent](https://academictorrents.com/details/95588a735c9ae4d123f3ca408e56570409bcf2a9), taken from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge). The normal dataset still needs refinement, especially around the edges of the images where lots of black pixels exists.
